(I'm focusing on the technical stuff. See this in action in my post, on [how I built my website](/notes/website-setup-2023))

## **SEO Pillars**

- **Technical** -- What the developer does
- **Creation** -- The content on the website
- **Popularity** -- Backlinks to your site from reputable sites

## **First off, fundamental knowledge**

As search engine web crawlers and users visit your web pages, they may encounter one of these HTTP status code messages. Some can affect your SEO!

import {
  Table,
  statusCodesTableRows,
  explicitTableRows,
  implicitTableRows,
} from "./tables";

<Table contents={statusCodesTableRows} />

## Explicit things you can do

There's a collection of obvious things developers do to improve SEO. Here they are.

<Table contents={explicitTableRows} />

## Implicit things you can do

These are strategies not so obvious that developers can do to improve SEO.

<Table contents={implicitTableRows} />

## Measuring Performance

[Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) are Google's terms referencing how they measure website performance.

The <ins>Core web vitals</ins> is a subset of web vitals that have 3 metrics that measure _loading_, _interactivity_, and _visual stability_ performance:

- LCP (largest contentful pain)
  - Time it takes for the largest element to load on the webpage
- FID (first input delay)
  - Time it takes for user's input to do something on the webpage
- CLS (cumulative layout shift)
  - Elements shifting after already being rendered

Google uses a website's core web vital scores to help _rank_ them.

- Scores are: **Good**, **Needs improvement**, **Poor**.

Tips to improve Web Vital Scores

- Optimizes images and fonts.
  - NextJS Image `<Image src={...} />`
  - Helps LCP and CLS score
- Use dynamic imports when possible `await import(...)`
  - Gets rid of warning to remove unused Javascript.
  - Helps FID score
- Defer loading third-party scripts until after the webpage content loads. `import Script from "next/script"`
