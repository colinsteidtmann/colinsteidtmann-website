# ESLint Reference Sheet

ESLint is a JavaScript package that you can add to your project. It lets you set up rules to self-enforce quality and consistent code.

## Quick Start

Install with setup help

```js
npm init @eslint/config
```

Clean install

```js
yarn add --dev eslint
```

### Configuring ESLint

ESLint's config file is `.eslintrc.js`. Let's assume it's blank:

```js
module.exports = {};
```

#### Rules

ESLint comes with a bunch of [rules](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/) that you can manually turn on.

```js
module.exports = {
  rules: {
    eqeqeq: "error",
    quotes: ["warn", "double"],
    semi: "2",
  },
};
```

`"eqeqeq"` is the rule name, found on ESLint's docs or from a plugin. After that is either the rule severity (e.g. `"error"`) or a list that has the severity followed by custom options which can be a string, object, etc, `["warn", "double"]`, it depends on the specific rule so check it's documentation. BTW, you can declare the severity with words or numbers: ` "0" = "off", "1" = "warn", "2" = "error"`.

#### Plugins

ESLint lets you define your own rules, or import someone else's rules that they created and published as an NPM package, eg. `eslint-plugin-react` which has linting rules for React and JSX. Or, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` which has linting rules for React Hooks.

```js
yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-react
```

```js
module.exports = {
	"plugins" ["react"],
	"rules" {
		"react/jsx-uses-vars": "error",
	}
}
```

Note, plugins require you to add the rules manually, if you don't want to do this then you should extend their config file.

#### Sharable Config Files

Manually adding rules and importing plugins gets tedious. Skip the work by extending someone else's config file that already has plugins and rules declared. Eg. `eslint:recommended` which comes with the `eslint` package or ones you've installed like `eslint-config-airbnb`. Extending a config file also imports their plugins. Below, we extend the airbnb config file which includes the react and react-hook plugins so we don't need to manually install them anymore!

```js
module.exports = {
	"extends": [
		"eslint:recommended",
		"airbnb",
		"airbnb/hooks"
	],
	(...)
}
```

Instead of downloading a separate `eslint-config-{pkgName}`, some plugins also come with a config file that you can use. Eg. `eslint-plugin-react`. Using it is as simple as:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ["plugin:react/recommended"],
};
```

The `plugin:` syntax tells eslint to look for the shared config file in the `eslint-plugin-react` package that we've installed. We don't need to declare `plugins: ["react"]` because the shared config file already does that!
