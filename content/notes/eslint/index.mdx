ESLint is a JavaScript package that you can add to your project. It lets you set up rules to self-enforce high-quality and consistent code.

_It won't do anything unless you extend someone else's config file or explicitly turn on rules in your config file._

## Quick Start and basic knowledge needed

Install with ESLint's setup help

```javascript
npm init @eslint/config
```

OR clean install

```javascript
yarn add --dev eslint
```

Run it with the ESLint CLI:
`npx eslint [options] file.js [file.js] [dir]` OR create a script in your `package.json` file ([CLI source](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface)).

### Configuring ESLint ([source](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/))

ESLint's config file is `.eslintrc.js`. Assume it's blank:

```javascript
module.exports = {};
```

#### Rules ([source](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/rules))

ESLint comes with a bunch of [rules](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/) that you can manually turn on.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  rules: {
    eqeqeq: "error",
    quotes: ["warn", "double"],
    semi: "2",
  },
};
```

`"eqeqeq"` is the rule name, found on ESLint's docs or from a plugin's ruleset. After that is either the rule severity (`"error"`) or a list that has the severity followed by options you can set formatted as string/object/... it depends on the specific rule (`["warn", "double"]`). You can declare the severity with words or numbers: ` "0" = "off", "1" = "warn", "2" = "error"`.

You can also use specific rules in certain files with comments

```javascript
/* eslint eqeqeq: "off", curly: "error" */
```

Again, you see the format - _rule name_ : _rule value_

Or you can enable/disable rules in certain files

```javascript
/* eslint-disable no-console -- For entire file*/
console.log("won't show");

alert("foo"); // eslint-disable-line no-alert -- Specific rule, this line only

// eslint-enable-next-line -- All rules, next line only
console.log("hey");

/* eslint-disable-next-line no-alert */
alert("foo");
```

#### Plugins ([source](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/plugins))

ESLint lets you define your own rules, or import someone else's rules that they created and published as an NPM package, eg. [`eslint-plugin-react`](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) which has linting rules for React and JSX. Or, [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) which has linting rules for React Hooks.

```javascript
yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-react
```

```javascript
module.exports = {
	"plugins" ["react"],
	"rules" {
		"react/jsx-uses-vars": "error",
	}
}
```

Note, plugins require you to add the rules manually, if you don't want to do this then you should extend their config file.

#### Sharable Config Files ([source](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#extending-configuration-files))

Manually adding rules and importing plugins gets tedious. Skip the work by extending someone else's config file which already includes plugins and rules declared. Eg. [`eslint: recommended`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#using-eslintrecommended) which comes with the `eslint` package or ones you've installed like [`eslint-config-airbnb`](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb). Extending a config file also imports their plugins. Below, we extend the Airbnb config file which includes the react and react-hook plugins so we don't need to manually install or declare them anymore, aka we can ~~`"plugins": ["react"]`~~!

```javascript
module.exports = {
	"extends": [
		"eslint:recommended",
		"airbnb",
		"airbnb/hooks"
	],
	(...)
}
```

Instead of downloading a separate config file, `eslint-config-{pkgName}`, some plugins also come with a config file that you can use. Eg. [`eslint-plugin-react`](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react). Using it is as simple as:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  extends: ["plugin:react/recommended"],
};
```

The `plugin:` syntax tells ESLint to look for the shared config file in the `eslint-plugin-react` package that we've installed.

## Advanced

These are sometimes not needed if you're extending from a config like [eslint-config-next](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/eslint-config-next). Still helpful knowledge to have.

### Environments ([source](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/language-options#specifying-environments))

Tell ESLint what environment your code runs in so that it knows the predefined global variables (e.g. the `"browser"` environment comes with vars like `window`).

```javascript
module.exports = {
    "env": {
        "browser": true,
        "node": true,
        "es6": true
    }
    (...)
}
```

### Parser Options

Tell ESLint what syntax you're using. ES3-ES5 is ESLint's default but ES6/ES2015 and beyond are modern-day JavaScript. Specifying `module` is important if you use `import`/`export` and `jsx` is important if you're using React.

```javascript
module.exports = {
    "parserOptions": {
        "ecmaVersion": "latest",
        "sourceType": "module",
        "ecmaFeatures": {
            "jsx": true
        }
    }
    (...)
}
```

### Custom rules

It gets fairly involved, here's [a good article](https://stevenpetryk.com/blog/custom-eslint-rules/) on it.

## My setup for a NextJS Website

### Config files I extend:

- [eslint:recommended](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/)
- [eslint-config-next](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/eslint-config-next) which includes in it:
  - Extends [`plugin:react/recommended`](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react)
  - Extends [`plugin:react-hooks/recommended`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)
  - Extends [`plugin:@next/next/recommended`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/eslint-plugin-next)
- [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) OR [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier#recommended-configuration)
  - Add this last so that prettier can override other configs.
  - Run the prettier script (`prettier --write`) _before_ the ESLint script (`eslint --fix`) or else you'll get issues when the prettier format conflicts with your ESLint rules.
    - A package called [prettier-eslint](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint) will do this for you (running Prettier then ESLint) but it's easy enough to do it yourself.

#### .eslintrc.json

```json
// .eslintrc.json
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "next",
    "next/core-web-vitals"
    "plugin:prettier/recommended",
  ],
  "rules": {
    "prettier/prettier": "error",
    "react/react-in-jsx-scope": "off",
    "react/prop-types": "off",
    "react/no-unescaped-entities": "off",
    "no-var": "error", // use let or const instead
    "require-await": "warn", // Disallow async functions which have no await expression
    "semi-style": ["warn", "last"], // semicolons must be at the end
    "semi": ["warn", "always"], // must use semi colons
    "quotes": [
      "warn",
      "double",
      { "allowTemplateLiterals": true, "avoidEscape": true }
    ], // must use double quotes
    "no-unused-vars": "warn" // don't have unused variables
  }
}
```

#### package.json

```json
//package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "lint-fix": "eslint . --fix",
    "prettier-check": "prettier --check .",
    "prettier-write": "prettier --write .",
    "clean": "prettier --write . && eslint . --fix"
  },
