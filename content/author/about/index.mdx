Hi, I'm Colin.

I'm in my third year at UC Berkeley, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, aka [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/). I _really love learning_, so outside of the two physical activities that I do (road biking 🚲 and walking my dog 🐾), I'm probably trying to learn something new 🙂.

export default ({ children }) => <MdxContent content={children} />;
